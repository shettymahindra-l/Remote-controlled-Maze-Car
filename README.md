# Bluetooth-Controlled Maze Car

This is an **ESP32-based Bluetooth remote-controlled maze car** that allows you to drive it using a smartphone. The project uses the **DabbleESP32 library** to interface with a gamepad and control the carâ€™s motors through PWM signals. It can move forward, backward, and turn left or right, making it ideal for maze navigation and robotics learning.

## âš™ How It Works

1. The ESP32 connects to the Dabble app via Bluetooth.
2. Button presses from the gamepad control the motor speeds and directions.
3. PWM signals manage the speed, while GPIO pins control motor direction.
4. The car can navigate a maze or be used in robotics experiments.
