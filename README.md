# Remote-controlled-Maze-Car
This project is an ESP32-based remote-controlled maze car that can be driven using a smartphone via Bluetooth. It uses the DabbleESP32 library to receive gamepad inputs and control the carâ€™s motors through PWM signals. The car can move forward, backward, turn left, and turn right, making it suitable for maze navigation and robotics experiments.
